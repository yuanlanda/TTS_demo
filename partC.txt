        <prosody rate="slow">A heart that's full up like a landfill
        A job that slowly kills you
        Bruises that won't heal</prosody>

        You look so tired and unhappy
        Bring down the government
        They don't, they don't speak for us
        I'll take a quiet life
        A handshake of carbon monoxide

        No alarms and no surprises
        No alarms and no surprises
        No alarms and no surprises
        Silent, silent

        This is my final fit, my final bellyache with

        No alarms and no surprises
        No alarms and no surprises
        No alarms and no surprises please

        Such a pretty house, such a pretty garden

        No alarms and no surprises (let me out of here)
        No alarms and no surprises (let me out of here)
        No alarms and no surprises please (let me out of here)
